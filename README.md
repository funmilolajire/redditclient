## General info  

This project is built on reddit's api, user's are able to see an initial view when first visiting the site, they can search for posts using terms, can filter the results based on predefined categories and view comments under each post. It is responsive and can be used on any modern browser.  
This project is built to practice my react, redux, and test driven development skills. I use git for version control, zenhub for project management, jest and enzyme to write unit tests, testcafe for end to end tests, gsap for animations, circleci to set up the project's ci/cd workflow, code climate for code coverage and maintainability, and wrote the code following web accessiblity best practices.
